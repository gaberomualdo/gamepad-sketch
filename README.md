# [GamepadSketch](https://xtrp.github.io/GamepadSketch/)

Web drawing application built for gamepads and game controllers.

> Note: this app is built for XBOX Controllers, but other gamepads such as PlayStation controllers will work with it as well.

## Technologies Used

This application is pretty simple, and just uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It utilizes the HTML5 Gamepad API for the gamepad functionality. Note: I recently wrote [a full tutorial on how to use the HTML5 Gamepad API](https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/12/15/how-to-use-the-html5-gamepad-api/), which explains most of how the communication with gamepads works in this app.
